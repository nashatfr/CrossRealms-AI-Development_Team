# CrossRealms Intern â€“ BlockShield AI Development Team

Welcome to my internship repository for the AI integration of the **BlockShield** project at **CrossRealms International**.

**BlockShield** is a cybersecurity solution that tracks over **1 million IP addresses** globally, identifying and blocking malicious actors in real-time. As part of the AI Development Team, I contributed to enhancing its intelligence layer through data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

This repo contains several projects and tasks I completed during the internship, with a focus on:

- ðŸ§  **AI integration**: Implementing models to detect patterns and classify threats.  
- ðŸ“Š **Data analysis**: Preprocessing large-scale logs, identifying suspicious behaviors, and engineering meaningful features.  
- ðŸ”’ **Cybersecurity insights**: Clustering and profiling IP activity to enhance detection strategies.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Reporting**: Documenting results, methodologies, and visual insights.
